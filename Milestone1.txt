Completed for Milestone 1:
1.) The sky map is a sphere with 3d time based perlin noise. The colors are interpolated both from the noise value and the distance from the horizon. I want to mess with the colors a bit more for the final, but this is the generate gist. I am going for that abstract sunset vibe. The shader also has a toon shader on top of the noise value. 

2.) The camera is animated along a closed spline with jittered knot points. The jitter is so that the animation is interesting with twists and turns. At the moment, the camera can do almost a 180 degree turn. I want to avoid that by restricting the jitter of the knot points to within a range of the surrounding knots. The camera also looks forward, which is good, but maybe it would be nice to be able to look around. I could let the user look around and when there is no mouse interaction, the view goes slowly back to forward (unlikely how it jerkily does this now). 

3.) There webpage runs a song and I have puts frequency analytics on the music. I hooked the frequency to the perlin noise in the sky, but didn't like the effect. I want to also attach it to the rocks in the scene, but I haven't gotten the right parameters for it to look right. 

4.) As for the main component, the canyon walls, I have tried multiple techniques. I tried first a vertical wall, but the noise looked strange. I also couldn't figure out to extend as the camera moved. I instead moved to a horizontal plane with very spiky noise close together. I still have the problem of extending with the camera movement, but I just figured out how to fix this, although haven't implemented it. From the spline data, I want to create a grayscale texture with black along the spline with a steep ramp to get the canyon walls. I should be able to send this texture to my shader and create a canyon that my camera can move through.
